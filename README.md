Telco Customer Churn Prediction


📌 Project Description

This project analyzes and predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. The notebook Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.ipynb contains complete data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

The goal of this project is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and build a predictive model to help reduce customer attrition.

🎯 Objectives

Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.ipynb

Run all cells to reproduce results.

🔍 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts show higher churn rates.

Higher monthly charges are correlated with churn.

Long-term customers are less likely to churn.

Contract type and tenure are strong churn predictors.

📌 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning

Use ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deploy the model as a web app

Improve feature engineering
